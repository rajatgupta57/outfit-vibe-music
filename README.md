# ðŸ‘•ðŸŽ§ Outfit Vibe Music

A fashion-meets-music web app that pairs your outfit's aesthetic with matching Spotify playlists built for Call2Code Hackathon 2025.

For Round 1, this is a manually-driven early prototype simulating what the final AI-driven experience would feel like.

##  How It Works

1. Upload your outfit photo (selfie or fit pic)
2. Select your outfit vibe manually: Casual / Formal / Sporty
3. Instantly get a Spotify playlist that matches your style

Final Version will include automatic clothing style detection using a Computer Vision API.
